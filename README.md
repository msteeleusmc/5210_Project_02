# 5210_Project_02
Iterative Deeping Search (IDS)

This is project 2 for CSCE 5210

Phase 1: 
I created an undirected weighted graph to establish my environment. I used 15 nodes, and 
added the predetermined weights to their edges based on project 2 documentation. Inspiration for
making this graph came from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/graph-implementation-using-stl-for-competitive-programming-set-2-weighted-graph/

Phase 1 cont'd: 
I decided to make a class versus just using function calls as done in Project 1. This of course
takes an object oriented approach to control which data structures accesses data. By creating a 
warehouse class, I would only be able to call those specific functions if intended too.
